To survive, you’ll choose a clan and enter into uneasy alliances with competing factions in a world which will react to every choice you make. Unleash your supernatural powers against your prey, but be mindful of your surroundings at all times or run the risk of breaking the Masquerade (the absolute law of secrecy that keeps Vampire society hidden from humanity).",

In order to reach the set target score, the narrator tries to explain the words before him to his teammates without using the forbidden words. While a team is telling, a person from the other team can check the banned words.\n\nThe first team to reach the target score wins the game. It is easier to reach the target score as the red team is always the first narrator. Therefore, for the Blue team to win the game, it is sufficient to get 2 points less than the target score. To explain this with an example, if the game ends with 20 points, it is enough for the blue team to collect 18 points.",
